1. Overview of AI Usage
I have used AI tools to speed up the project, I have mentioned below how and what prompts were used by me:

2. Prompts Used
Below ar prompts used during the development process:

- "Create a Python script using asyncio and websockets to connect to Binance 
   stream and save trade data to a local SQLite database."
- "How do I calculate a rolling hedge ratio and Z-score using Python pandas 
   and statsmodels?"
- "Show me how to make a 5-row subplot in Plotly that shares the X-axis."
- "Write a function to simulate a simple mean-reversion backtest given a 
   Z-score series."
- "All the requirements are met ?"

A. Backend (Ingestion)
   - AI was used to draft the 'asyncio' pattern for handling WebSocket connections 
     robustly, specifically the reconnection logic in 'ingestion.py'.
   - Generated standard SQL queries for creating the SQLite table schema.

B. Analytics (Math)
  - Consulted AI to confirm the correct implementation of the OLS Regression 
     syntax using 'statsmodels.api' to ensure the intercept was handled correctly.
  - Requested a template for the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test interpretation.

C. Frontend (Visualization)
   - Used AI to generate the 'Plotly' subplot structure to stack 5 rows of charts 
     (Price, Spread, Z-Score, Correlation, PnL) efficiently.
   - Assisted in writing the 'Streamlit' state management logic for the 
     auto-refresh loop.
